My name is Ashley and I love building stuff. I've been building websites and apps for well over 10 years. For the last couple of years, I've been building awesome ecommerce experiences for clients ranging from chocolate to bridal gowns to knives. [Contact Me](/contact/) and I'll be happy to share more about my experiences with you.

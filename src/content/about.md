Hi! I'm Ashley, a web developer based in Seattle, WA who enjoys building things that live on the Internet. Designing and coding have been my passion since I started working with computers. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive, and functional websites and apps.

After working in the Midwest and the South, my husband convinced me to move to Seattle (he's a native). I've been living here for over 2 years and I think it's a great place to call home.

When I'm not designing or developing neat stuff, I'm enjoying the great Pacific Northwest outdoors with my husband and dog, Dudley.
